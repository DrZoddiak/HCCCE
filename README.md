# Welcome to the first HelpChat Community Code Experiment.

## What even is this?
Well glad you asked, one day we decided to see what would happen if you only allowed people to commit to a plugin that met a certain character limit.
Everyone is welcome to participate just make sure you read the rules below before you get started.

## Topic:
This is the first ever HCCCE and doesn't really have a defined topic, so make it yours!

## Rules:
• Commits must be no more than 100 characters in total.
• You can not modify any code you did not push, work around it.
• You can only commit after 3 other commits have been pushed by other people.
• If you commit breaking code that renders the plugin non compilable, you must wait 6 commits to push more code.
• No malicious code, duh.
• You must comment your code with your name so we know who authored everything.
• Comments don't count towards the characters limit, but comments mustn't have code in them.
